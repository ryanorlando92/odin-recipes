        <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        
            2 pints (20 oz) grape tomatoes<br>
            5 medium garlic cloves, peeled and halved<br>
            1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
            Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
            7 - 8 oz. block feta cheese (sheep's milk variety, such as Murray's), drained<br>
            10 oz. dry pasta such as campanelle, rigatoni, rotini, penne, bow tie, or cavatappi<br>
            8 oz. spinach, roughly chopped (8 packed cups)<br>
            1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil<br>
            2 Tbsp minced fresh parsley<br>
            1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste<br>
            1/2 cup reserved pasta water<br>
            <br>
    </p>
 <br>
  
    <p>
        <h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
        Step 1<br>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees<br>
        <br>
        Step 2<br>
        Add grape tomatoes and garlic to a 3 quart baking dish. 
        Toss with olive oil and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Place feta in the center of tomatoes, turn to coat with oil.<br>
        <br>
        Step 3<br>
        Bake in center of preheated oven for 30 minutes, 
         Then remove the baking dish, raise oven rack up to upper 1/3 of the oven. Return baking dish to oven and increase oven to 450 
         degrees. Bake until tomatoes and cheese are starting to brown slightly, about 10 minutes longer.<br>
        <br>
        Step 4<br>
        Meanwhile boil pasta to al dente in salted water (I use 1 Tbsp salt and about 3 or 4 quarts of water), according to time listed on pasta package.
        Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water and right before draining pour and submerge spinach in with the pasta (it should wilt almost instantly). 
        Drain pasta and spinach.<br>
        <br>
        Step 5<br>
        Smash the tomatoes, garlic, oil and feta together with the back of a wooden spoon. Toss pasta in with mixture along with basil, parsley and red pepper flakes.
        Thin mixture with a few tablespoons of pasta water at a time to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm.
